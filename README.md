### What is the BabySitter App all about

## The Problem

So COVID came by and made Remote work possible. Yay!!!. Now it's possible to work in our pyjamas from our bedrooms,sipping coffee from that large Mug we've always dreamt of. I don't know about you, but to me, working like this is a dream come true.
<br />
<br />
But now, the noise ðŸ¥².
<br />
<br />
Most of us are parents. For some sweet reason, our kids always decide to show how much they love us, during zoom meetings.
<br />
<br />
They're either banging on the closed door or creating some noise with stuff from outside, because there's nobody to sit and put them in order.
<br />
<br />
There has to be a solution to this ðŸ¤”. Yeahhhh... Get a nanny.But then, issues come in.
<br />

- Firstly, where or how do you meet this nanny ?

- Supporsing you meet them ,are you comfortable leaving your kids with somebody you don't know ?

- How do you evaluate the them to know if they are a good fit for your kids ?

- How can you speak to other people that have worked with them in the past ?
  <br />
  And a ton of other questions.

What if there's an online website just for stuff like this. Where you can see people willing to carryout nanny duties.
<br />
They are a ratings and feedback system, and you can actually see reviews from previous jobs they've done.
<br />
<br />
That's the main purpose of this Project.
<br />
I'll attempt to create an `Event Driven Application`, based on this use Case.
<br />

## The Solution

This REPO would contain all the code for the serverless GraphQL API.
