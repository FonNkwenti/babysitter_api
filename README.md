### What is the BabySitter App all about

## The Problem

So COVID came along and made Remote work possible. Yay!!!. Now it's possible to work in our pyjamas from our bedrooms,sipping coffee from that large Mug we've always dreamt of. 
I don't know about you, but to me, working like this is a dream come true.
<br />
<br />
But as the saying goes, 
> When you pray for the rain, you've got to deal with the mud too

Working from home ain't all sunshine and merry making.
Most of us are parents, and for some sweet reason, our kids always decide to show how much they love us, during zoom meetings or when we want to put some work in.
<br />
<br />
They're either banging on the closed door or creating some noise with stuff from outside, because there's nobody to sit and put them to order.
<br />
<br />
There has to be a solution to this ðŸ¤”. Yeahhhh... Get a nanny.But then,other issues come in.
<br />

- Firstly, where or how do i get this nanny ?

- Supposing you meet them ,are you comfortable leaving your kids with somebody you just met ?

- How do you evaluate them to know if they are a good fit for your kids ?

- How can you speak to other parents that have worked with them in the past ?
  <br />
  And a ton of other questions.

BUT!!!!! 
<br />
What if there's an online website just for stuff like this. 
- Where you can meet people willing to carryout nanny duties.
- You can post job offers 
- See Nanny ratings based on previous jobs they've completed
- Book a nanny
- etc
<br />
That's the main purpose of this Project.
<br />
I don't intend to build the whole thing, but only to serve as a source of inspiration for some super ninja
out there who's willing to go all in on building something similar
<br />

## Proposed Solution

This REPO would contain all the code for the babysitter serverless GraphQL API.
